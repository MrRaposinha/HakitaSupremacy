## 🌟 Features

- **Hakita Plushie Spawner**: Automatically spawns a plushie of Hakita at the start of every level.
- **Smart Respawn System** *(New in v1.1.0)*: Plushies that fall into the void or disappear from the map are automatically teleported back to the player.
- **Organized Spawn** *(New in v1.1.0)*: Plushies now spawn neatly stacked above the player’s head at the start of each level, preventing chaotic scatter.
- **Notification System** *(New in v1.1.0)*: A message now appears when plushies are respawned, indicating the exact number retrieved.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Adds a layer of strategy to ULTRAKILL, as you must protect and carry the plushie while navigating intense combat scenarios.
- **Challenge-Ready**: Perfect for self-imposed challenges, speedruns, or just a bit of fun!

## 🚧 Limitations

- **Manual Checkpoint Restarts**: Plushies do not respawn when the player forcefully restarts from a checkpoint, requiring additional care during these scenarios.
- **Persistent Plushie**: The plushie respawns only if it falls out of the map or is removed, but no longer respawns automatically upon player death.
